# Creating MSIs with cx_Freeze for Distribution to Managed Users

Distributing software applications in a managed enterprise environment can be a complex and challenging task.
One popular method for deploying and managing software across multiple machines is to use Windows MSI files, which
provide a standardized and reliable way of managing application installations, updates, and removals. A recent project
I worked on required the creation of an MSI file for a Python application using the cx_Freeze library. Throughout this post,
I will examine some of the challenges faced during this project, specifically surrounding customizing the installation process
so that it could be distributed to users with varying permissions. I will also discuss some of the tools I used
to create the MSI file, and how I was able to move past some of the challenges caused by the sparse documentation of
cx_Freeze.

<br />

## Setup.py

Setup.py is used by cx*freeze to set options for freezing and building your application into an executable \_and*
for packaging that executable into an installer. In this case, an MSI using the `bdist_msi` command.

An example options variable looks like this:

<CodeContainer
  title="setup.py"
  language="python"
  value={`
    options = {
    "build_exe": {
        "bin_excludes": ["libqpdf.so", "libqpdf.dylib"],
        # exclude packages that are not really needed
        "excludes": [
            "tkinter",
            "unittest",
            "http",
            "pydoc",
        ],
        "packages": [
            "PySide6.QtCore",
            "PySide6.QtGui",
            "PySide6.QtWidgets",
            "barcode",
            "email",
            "win32api",
            "win32print",
            "debugpy",
        ],
        "include_files": [
            find_data_file("template.png"),
            find_data_file("icon.ico"),
            find_data_file("error.png"),
            find_data_file("PRinter/pythoncom310.dll"),
            find_data_file("PRinter/pywintypes310.dll"),
        ],
        "optimize": 1,
        "silent": True,
        # Include the Microsoft Visual C Redistributable for Pyside6
        "include_msvcr": True,
    },
    "bdist_msi": bdist_msi_options,
    }
`}
/>

The options variable should be a dictionary with the command names as keys and desired options as values. For example,
the `build_exe` item includes the options related to freezing and building your application. Nothing is too spectacular
here - by following through the cx_freeze docs, you should be able to get to this point.

Note that the `find_data_files` method is just for finding other required files. Depending on if the application is frozen
or not, they can be in a different location:

<CodeContainer
  title="find_data_file"
  language="python"
  value={`
    # Data Files
    def find_data_file(filename):
    if getattr(sys, "frozen", False):
        # The application is frozen
        datadir = os.path.dirname(sys.executable)
    else:
        # The application is not frozen
        # Change this bit to match where you store your data files:
        datadir = os.path.dirname("./")
    return os.path.join(datadir, filename)
`}
/>

### bdist_msi

You may have noticed that the build options are in-lined directly inside the options variable but the bdist_msi options
are stored in their own variable. This is mainly for readability and separating the "meat" of this problem into
its own section. Here's what my bdist_msi looks like:

<CodeContainer
  title="bdist_msi"
  language="python"
  value={`
    bdist_msi_options = {
    "summary_data": {
        "author": "George",
        "comments": "Sample application",
        "keywords": "PySide6",
    },
    # Icon for the installer
    "install_icon": find_data_file("icon.ico"),
    "initial_target_dir": rf"C:\Program Files\{company_name}\{product_name}",
    # Unique GUID for the application - for updates
    "upgrade_code": UPGRADE_CODE,
    "data": msi_data,
    "all_users": True,
    # Skip the build process - use to build and sign the exe separately
    # run build command first, then sign the exe, then run this command
    "skip_build": False,
    }
`}
/>

The most important options here are:

initial_target_dir
: Target install location, or where you want the program to be located on the user's machine.

upgrade_code
: A GUID that you generate to represent your application. This way when the version increases on your application,
the operating system knows that it is the same software and should replace the old version

all_users
: Determines if the application is installed for all users on the target machine or just the logged on user.

data
: Stores any custom MSI data needed for your installation.

You may notice that the `initial_target_dir` is hardcoded to the C: drive, which is not great. This is just to give the
`initial_target_dir` a value. It gets overwritten during the final installation process.

This is where information started being harder to find, in regard to properly configuring the bdist_msi options. Some of
the options available are not documented well, and required a bit of digging to find out they existed and how to use them.

**Before going forward** you should understand at a basic level that MSIs are more akin to a lot of small database tables
that contain information about your program and how to install it. This can be difficult to wrap your head around, as it
is different from the typical scripting approach. It may be beneficial if you install Orca (mentioned further down) and
opening an installer for yourself.

With that out of the way, the `msi_data` variable contains _tables_ that are to be inserted into the MSI package:

<CodeContainer
  title="msi_data"
  language="python"
  value={`
    # This will be part of the 'data' option of bdist_msi
    msi_data = {
    "Shortcut": shortcut_table,
    "Property": property_table,
    "CustomAction": custom_action_table,
    "InstallExecuteSequence": sequence_table,
    }
`}
/>

### [Shortcut Table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/shortcut-table)

As you may guess by the name, the Shortcut table is responsible for creating shortcuts on the target machine. It has
quite a few columns, all of which can be seen in the linked documentation. Of those, the ones worth paying attention to the most are:

- Directory\_
- Identifier for the directory table
- Name
- Name of your shortcut
- Target
- Shortcut target - your program

<CodeContainer
  title=" Shortcut Table"
  language="python"
  value={`
    shortcut_table = [
    (
        "DesktopShortcut",           # Shortcut
        "DesktopFolder",             # Directory_
        "MH Label Printer",          # Name
        "TARGETDIR",  # Component_
        f"[TARGETDIR]{TARGET_NAME}", # Target
        None,                        # Arguments
        None,                        # Description
        None,                        # Hotkey
        "",                          # Icon - None for default
        None,                        # IconIndex
        None,                        # ShowCmd
        "TARGETDIR",                 # WkDir
    ),
    (
        "StartMenuShortcut",         # Shortcut
        "StartMenuFolder",           # Directory_
        "MH Label Printer",          # Name
        "TARGETDIR",                 # Component_
f"[TARGETDIR]{TARGET_NAME}",         # Target
        None,                        # Arguments
        None,                        # Description
        None,                        # Hotkey
        "",                          # Icon - None for default
        None,                        # IconIndex
        None,                        # ShowCmd
        "TARGETDIR",                 # WkDir
    ),
    ]
`}
/>

Notice how the Directory\_ column has some interesting values for both shortcut entries. `DesktopFolder` and `StartMenuFolder`.
These are [System Folder Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/property-reference#system-folder-properties),
which are environment variables for common locations on the target machine.

### [Property Table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/property-table)

The property table contains names and values for any defined properties used in the installation. I have set `TARGETDIR`
to "test" here. This property is also set by cx_freeze itself via the `initial_target_dir` variable from earlier.

<CodeContainer
  title="Property Table"
  language="python"
  value={`
    property_table = [
    ("TARGETDIR", "test"),
    ("MANUFACTURER", company_name),
    ("PUBLISHER", company_name),
    ]
`}
/>

### [Custom Action Table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/customaction-table)

The custom action table is for you to include custom code or functionality in your installation package.
There are a [wide variety of available action types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/summary-list-of-all-custom-action-types),
but the one we are inteterested in is number **51**, "Property set with formatted text." The _formatted text_ part of that is important.
The formatted text allows the use of the **environment variables**. Thus, we can change the target directory using information gathered **during** the installation.

<CodeContainer
  title=" Custom Action Table"
  language="python"
  value={`
    # Custom Actions table
    custom_action_table = [
    (
        "SetTargetDir",
        "51",
        "TARGETDIR",
        f"[%PROGRAMFILES]" + f"\\{company_name}\\{product_name}",
    )
    ]
`}
/>

After including this in the installer, we have the action to set the `TARGETDIR` property, but it is not being
used anywhere in the process yet. That is where the Sequence Table comes in.

### [Sequence Table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/using-a-sequence-table)

There are a few sequence tables that can be used when creating an MSI, depending on if the installation is an Advertisement,
done by an Admin, or just ran by a user. The one we are interested in is `InstallExecuteSequence`, which is what happens
when the installer is run in silent mode (no UI or console window popup)

<CodeContainer
  title="find_data_file"
  language="python"
  value={`
    # Add custom action to sequence table
    sequence_table = [
    ("SetTargetDir", "", "800"),
    ]
`}
/>

We only have one entry here, and it is adding our custom action to sequence 800. It took some trial and error to find
out how far into the installation is correct. Too early and it will get overridden by the cx_freeze options;
too late and the installer has already started with the original value.

## Testing the MSI

Adding these custom tables to the MSI installer required a bit of trial and error. You can probably add
some of the other MSI tables as well, assuming the correct values are provided. There are a few tools that will be useful for this section:

- [CMTrace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/support/tools) - Allows you to view a logfile as it is
  running. Use when running MSIs with verbose logging enabled
- [Orca](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/orca-exe) - For viewing created MSI files and inspecting the
  tables within. Can also be used to make / apply transformation files, but I did not find that to be necessary for this
  process. Most useful for debugging and comparing your MSI to a functioning one.
- [PsExec](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) - Lets you simulate running your installer
  as the "System" user. Only important if you are creating an MSI to be used with deployment software. Depending on the
  privilleges of your Active Directory environment and where your application writes files, you may run into permission
  issues (I sure did!).

When you are ready to test your MSI file, run `python setup.py bdist_msi` to build and package your program.
We will complete the following steps:

1. Use PsExec to open a command prompt as the **LOCAL SYSTEM** account. <sup>[1]</sup>
2. Run installer with options for silent install `/Qn` and verbose logging `/lV*`
3. Inspect package with Orca if not functioning as expected. For example, when trying to find the correct sequence
   value for the custom action described above, I had to do _a lot_ of trial and error with Orca and CMTrace

See below for an example:

![psexec_example](/psexec_example.jpg)

Now, run the installation command, with logging:
`msiexec.exe /i "MSI_LOCATION"/qN /lV* "LOGFILE_OUTPUT_LOCATION"`

You should see a log file appear at the specified location. Open the logfile with CMTrace. I advise keeping an eye on
this as it installs. If you have made a mistake with the MSI tables you are adding manually to the installer,
it tends to fail early on. Look for red lines in CM_Trace and start reading up until you find the error.
The Windows Installer Error Messages page <sup>[2]</sup> will be useful for understanding any messages that appear.
Here is an example of the CMTrace interface:

![CMTrace example](/cmtrace.jpg)

If you need to open the file with Orca and already have it installed,there will be an "Edit with Orca" option in the
right click menu for any MSI file. You will see a list of tables inside the left sidebar. The rows on the right show
what is included in the selected table.

## Conclusion

I hope this has been helpful for anyone who is trying to create an MSI installer for their Python application. One resource
that I found very useful was [this series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/robmen/deciphering-the-msi-directory-table-part-6-standard-directories)
of blog posts by Rob Mensching, who worked on the MSI format for Windows Installer.
He also is behind the [WIX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) which is a very popular tool for creating MSI installers.
